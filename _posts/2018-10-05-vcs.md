VCS(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control system</a>) is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.

> This tutorial examplifies VCS with Git as well as its remote service Github.

## Why do we use VCS ?
*to establish a more collaborative , intuitive , efficient programming environment.*

## terminology in VCS
- **working directory** : the folder you'r presently working on
- **staging area** : you add your files to the staging area before making a commit
- **local repository(Git)** : after making all the changes , you commit those files to the local repository
- **remote repository(Github)** : repo stored in online server
- **add** : transitional act between working directory and staging area
- **commit** : transitional act between staging area and local repository
- **push** : transitional act between local repository and remote repository
- **pull** : validates if it executes the expected sequence of events
- **clone** : download files into your local repo
- **branch** : experimental stage(fork) for your masetr-branch 

## What is actually Git and Github ?
plainly speaking 
- **Git** : local repository(versioned)
- **Github** : remote repository(versioned)

## setup sequence in git-bash

### initalize a local repo
- `git init` 
![init](https://res.cloudinary.com/dn18ydekv/image/upload/v1538730130/blog_vcs/init_git.png)

### add relevant file to staging area
- `git add .`
![add](https://res.cloudinary.com/dn18ydekv/image/upload/v1538743493/blog_vcs/add.png)

### commit changes to local repo
- `git commit -a -m "msg"`
![commit](https://res.cloudinary.com/dn18ydekv/image/upload/v1538730142/blog_vcs/commit_changes.png)

### configure link between Git and Github
- `git config --global user.name unclebob7-github`
- `git remote add origin -----.git`

## Branch mechanism
*Brach is one of those fascinating features that popular CVS service shares in order to perform trials on replicated , staing repo*
- `git branch test_branch`

after certain changes been made and committed
- `git checkout master`
- `git merge test_branch`

finally , as usual , we commit and push
- `git commit`
- `git push origin master` or `git push gh-pages` (whatever...)
