## NP ?= P

*Venn diagram* of the relations is as follows :

### intuition

- **P problem** : acronym of **Polynomial problem**, indicating problems that can be solved(**seek a way out**) in polynomial times, **O(1),O(log(n)),O(n^a)**

- **NP problem** : acronym of **Nondeterministic Polynomial problem**, indicating problems that a poly-time solution(**P**) hasn't been figured out so far, might or might not exist, however, a possible group of gusses(**certificates**) is existent and could be verified to be *true* with a poly-time verfier.

- **NP-complete problem** : concept derived from **Cook-Levin Theory** that all **NP problem** can be reduced to a corresponding **NP-complete problem** in poly-time, and **NP-complete** is considered the hardest subset of **NP**, sharing the same definition of **NP**, and is considered a super-form of it. That if a **P** can be found for any **NP-complete**, Then NP = P.

- **NP-hard problem** : a solution(**P**) might or might not exist, and the **certificates** migth or might not exist.

### illustration with Mario Universe

[World 2-1](http://www.mariouniverse.com/maps-nes-smb/)

We have our **Mario** and **Luigi** (lifelike as it is...) at our starting point. 

Start with something simple, how about staying alive till the **P-plane**, **Luigi** takes the upper-route, while **Mario** stays on the ground.

Incoming the **NP-plane**, We have ![Mario 2i](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclebob7/geekit/gh-pages/assets/img/mario2i.png) and ![Luigi 2j](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclebob7/geekit/gh-pages/assets/img/luigi2j.png) solutions.

Concretely, we might not know whether all the poly-time way out thoroughly, but I reassuringly have a way out(**certificate**) that can be verified poly-time executable(**verifier**).

Finally, in the present level, there's always a destination, which all the previous, periodical stage can reduce to. If I can figure out **all the possible way to reach my destination** (**P**), then all possible way out to any of my **periodical stage** is poly-time conceivable. (**NP = P**) 

How about the designer morbidly intended to kill our adorable Mario Bros yet we don't know ?

There is possibly somewhere in the graph that poor Mario Bros have no way to pass such that it remains unknown whether a **certificate** is existent which is **poly-time verifiable**.
