Traditional Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) based Java reverse engineering tools are strictly rule defined, thus are not fault-tolerant, which pose serious problem when noise and interference were introduced into the system. ○ Proposed framework depends on attention-based NMT and Transformer models whose key essence is to view reverse engineering as a
statistical, machine translation task. To evaluate the robustness and fault-tolerance of the framework, I tested on datasets crawled from Oracle. ○ Experimental results demonstrated that the framework is more robust and fault-tolerant compared to traditional Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) based reverse engineering tools. Specifically, the performance has achieved 92.3 and 3.48% in terms of BLEU and minimum word error rate which is the state-of-the-art.
